# sentry-opentelemetry-otlp-spring

This module combines `sentry-opentelemetry-otlp` with the OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter for a simpler setup in Spring Boot applications.

It is intended for setups where OpenTelemetry handles tracing (with spans exported via OTLP to Sentry) while Sentry handles errors, logs, metrics, and other products.

Please consult the documentation on how to install and use this integration in the [Sentry Docs for Java](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/opentelemetry/setup/otlp/).
